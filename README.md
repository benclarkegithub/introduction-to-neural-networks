# Introduction to Neural Networks

For the presentation "An Intuitive Introduction to Neural Networks" given at Bank of America.
`IntroductionToNeuralNetworks.ipynb` trains and visualises the weights of a neural network with one hidden layer trained on the MNIST dataset.

For reference, a logistic regression model trained on MNIST might have the following weights ([source](https://dmkothari.github.io/Machine-Learning-Projects/Logistic_Regression_with_MNIST.html)):

In contrast, the weights of the input layer to the hidden layer of a neural network trained on MNIST:

And, the weights of the hidden layer to the output units 0 and 1:
